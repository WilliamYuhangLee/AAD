First, create an instance on Google
When you are creating a new instance, please specify your boot disk to be larger than 35GB, so you can fit EMADE

Else, if you already have an instance set up and EMADE is too big, you can add disk size by doing the following: (else please skip to emade installation)

Add new disk on the GCP console

1. Click the name of the instance where you want to add a disk.
2. At the top of the instance details page, click Edit.
3. Under Additional disks, click Add item.
4. In the Name drop-down menu, click Create disk.
5. Specify a name for the disk, configure the disk's properties and select the Blank disk option.
6. Click Create to create the disk.
7. At the bottom of the instance details page, click Save to apply your changes to the instance and attach the new disk.
8. After you create and attach a new disk to an instance, you must format and mount the disk so that the operating system can use the available storage space.

Format and Mount the disk (Go to the instance and click on SSH to go to the terminal for your instance)

1. Check device id:
sudo lsblk
2. format and mount disk, (where [DEVICE_ID] is the same name from last step, for example mine was sdb)
sudo mkfs.ext4 -m 0 -F -E lazy_itable_init=0,lazy_journal_init=0,discard /dev/[DEVICE_ID]
3. setup mount point for the new disk! (where [MNT_DIR] is the directory for you to mount your disk)
sudo mkdir -p /mnt/disks/[MNT_DIR]
4. Configure read and write permissions on the device (the following grants write access to all users)
sudo chmod a+w /mnt/disks/[MNT_DIR]
5. Check your disk space to see if you have more than ~30GB for EMADE
df -h

Alright, now for the all exciting EMADE installation you are waiting for (remember to be in the disk when you are cloning)

1. Update the apt-get package manager.
sudo apt-get update
2. Install MySQL. The installation process starts the MySQL service for you.
sudo apt-get -y install mysql-server
3. Install git
sudo apt-get install git
4. Download git lfs
curl -s https://packagecloud.io/install/repositories/github/git-lfs/script.deb.sh | sudo bash
5. Install git lfs
sudo apt-get install git-lfs
6. Config your git account
git config --global credential.helper cache
7. clone the repository (or your own fork)
git clone https://github.gatech.edu/emade/emade
8. Enter your gatech enterprise account
9. Wait

Get anaconda
1. cd into tmp
cd /tmp
2. Go to the anaconda download page and copy the link to the latest anaconda, or just use the following if you are lazy
curl -O [LINK_YOU_COPIED]
OR:
curl -O https://repo.continuum.io/archive/Anaconda3-2018.12-Linux-x86_64.sh
3. Verify the integrity of the installer just in case
sha256sum [INSTALLER_NAME]
OR: if you used my link
sha256sum Anaconda3-2018.12-Linux-x86_64.sh
4. Install Anaconda
bash [INSTALLER_NAME]
OR:
bash Anaconda3-2018.12-Linux-x86_64.sh
5. Read and agree the license, and modify the location if you need to, I did not
6. If you encounter this issue: "bunzip2: command not found", please install bzip2, and run the previous step with "-u" flag at the end
sudo apt-get install bzip2
7. Gonna ask you to initialize conda in home, put yes to make your life easier
8. Don't get vscode
9. Activate conda with:
source ~/.bashrc
10. Test to see if conda was installed correctly
conda list

Setup the environment for emade
1. After you activate conda, create a new environment
conda create --name [YOUR_ENV_NAME] python=3.5.0
2. Activate your newly created env
conda activate [YOUR_ENV_NAME]


Working with Docker
1. Set up Docker repository, get these if you don't have them already
sudo apt-get install \
    apt-transport-https \
    ca-certificates \
    curl \
    gnupg-agent \
    software-properties-common
2. Add the Docker official GPG key
curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg | sudo apt-key add -
3. Set up the stable repo (this is for standard x86_64 / amd64 machines, if you got some other instances, please look up the official Docker guide for the right arch)
sudo add-apt-repository \
   "deb [arch=amd64] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu \
   $(lsb_release -cs) \
   stable"
4. Update the package database with Docker packages
sudo apt update
5. Install Docker from Docker repo
sudo apt-get install docker-ce
6. Verify
sudo docker run hello-world


If you encounter a qsub error, please install qsub:

sudo apt install slurm-wlm-torque
sudo apt install gridengine-client
