# AAD
**Yuhang Li**'s personal repository for **AAD**.

**Automated Algorithm Design (AAD)** is a team in the _Vertically-Integrated Projects_ program at _Georgia Institute of Technology_.

AAD is dedicated to develop a framework that fundamentally alters the development of algorithms. We desire to create an automated method that starts with the best human algorithms and then dispassionately develops hybrid algorithms that outperform existing methods, and then prove that these algorithms can also be studied by humans for inspiration in development of new algorithm and optimization methods.
